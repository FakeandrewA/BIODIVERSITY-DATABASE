  <br>The threats to biodiversity are numerous and varied, but there are several strategies that can be employed to mitigate these threats:<br>

1. Recycling:<br><br>The adage to reduce, reuse, and recycle is excellent, but at this point, we're just going. This helps to reduce waste and pollution, which can harm biodiversity.
<br>
2. Sustainable Purchasing:<br><br>Buying sustainably can help to protect biodiversity. This could involve choosing products that are made with sustainable materials or that have been produced in an environmentally friendly manner.<br>
<br>
3. Preventing Invasive Species:<br><br>The best thing you can do is prevent invasive species from happening. Grow native plants in your garden, don’t travel with fruits or vegetables and never release aquarium fish or other exotic pets into the wild.<br>
<br>
4. Reducing Deforestation:<br><br>When we cut down a forest to use its lumber or claim the land for agricultural purposes, we destroy unique ecosystems that can't exist elsewhere.<br>
<br>
5. Reducing Pollution:<br><br>Garbage dumped into the water supply, chemical runoff from industrial applications, and air pollution from cars and factories all have a negative effect.<br>
<br>
6. Addressing Climate Change:<br>Changes in the climate can happen naturally over millions of years — look at the end of the last ice age. This time, though, climate change has been the result of human intervention.<br>
<br>
7. Eliminating Harmful Subsidies:<br><br>Eliminating subsidies that support local and national activities harmful to biodiversity – such as deforestation, over-fertilization and over-fishing, can also support climate change mitigation and adaptation.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, while the threats to biodiversity are significant, there are many actions that individuals, communities, and governments can take to help protect and preserve our planet's diverse ecosystems.<br>
